# FullStack Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the FullStack Developer Portfolio! This project is a web application created with **React** and styled with **React-Bootstrap** and **Animate.css** to deliver an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Built with**

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React-Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.
- **Animate.css**: CSS animation library to add dynamic effects to navigation.

## üöÄ **Getting Started with Create React App**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing an optimized development and build environment.

## üìú **Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically whenever you make changes.\
Lint errors will appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
React is optimized for the best performance, creating a minified version of the code with unique filenames.

Your app is ready to be deployed! For more details, see the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you want full control over the build configurations like webpack and Babel, `eject` will copy all the configuration files and dependencies directly into your project.
